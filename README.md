# Smart Waste Management System

## Abstract

The Smart Waste Management System aims to address the inefficiencies in current waste management practices. By implementing IoT technology, this system automatically detects the waste levels in trash cans and sends notifications to garbage collectors with the exact location of the trash can. This approach not only helps in efficient collection but also reduces travel time and costs. Post-collection, the system segregates waste for recycling, potentially reducing waste by up to 80%.

## Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- **Arduino Uno Board**: The microcontroller that processes sensor data and controls the system.
- **Dustbins**: Containers for collecting waste.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures the level of waste in the dustbin.
- **Wi-Fi Module**: Connects the system to the internet for data transmission.
- **Servo Motors**: Controls the opening and closing mechanisms of the dustbin.

### Software Requirements

- **Arduino IDE**: Software for programming the Arduino Uno board.

## Introduction

Waste management encompasses all activities required to manage waste from its inception to final disposal, including collection, transport, treatment, and disposal. With rapid urbanization and increasing waste production, effective waste management has become crucial. The traditional waste management systems often fall short, leading to health and economic issues. The integration of IoT can offer a more efficient solution to these problems.

## Objectives

- **Environmental Protection**: To ensure effective waste management and protect the environment.
- **Awareness and Responsibility**: Create awareness and instill responsibility in individuals regarding waste disposal.
- **Clean Surroundings**: Promote clean surroundings and better health conditions.
- **Efficient Waste Management**: Collect, dispose, and recycle waste efficiently.

## Existing System

Current waste management systems face issues such as improper garbage collection and overflow of trash bins. This leads to uncollected garbage and potential health hazards. The proposed system addresses these issues by providing real-time information on waste levels, enabling timely collection and reducing the accumulation of waste.

## Proposed System

The Smart Waste Management System uses ultrasonic sensors to detect the level of waste in dustbins. This data is transmitted to the cloud via an Arduino and Wi-Fi module, allowing for real-time monitoring through a website. The system notifies garbage collectors when bins are full, improving the efficiency of waste collection and enabling better recycling processes.

## Motivation

In many developing countries, waste management is a significant challenge due to inefficient collection methods and poor disposal practices. The proposed system addresses these issues by using sensors to monitor waste levels and sending alerts through SMS, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of waste management.

## Problem Statement

Urban cities face challenges in waste management, including overflowing bins, unhygienic conditions, and air pollution. Traditional systems often fail to address these issues efficiently, leading to increased time and costs. The proposed system offers a solution by providing real-time data on waste levels and improving collection efficiency.

## Getting Started

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino Uno board.
   - Integrate the Wi-Fi module with the Arduino.
   - Install servo motors for automated bin operations.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Install the Arduino IDE on your computer.
   - Write and upload the Arduino code to the Uno board.
   - Configure the Wi-Fi module to connect to the internet.
   - Develop a web interface for monitoring waste levels.

3. **Operation**:
   - Place the ultrasonic sensor in the dustbin to monitor waste levels.
   - Data will be transmitted to the cloud and displayed on the web interface.
   - Garbage collectors will receive notifications and can collect waste efficiently.
